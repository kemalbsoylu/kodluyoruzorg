            <p>In writing his tales, Tolkien created an alternative mythic history for our own world. Here are the most important locations in the The Lord of the Rings and its backstory. </p>
            <h3>Arda</h3>
            <p>The world, created by Ilvatar, the high god in Tolkien's stories. At first Arda was flat, encircled by a great sea. However, when Ilvatar changed the shape of the world and destroyed the island of Nmenor, the world was made into a sphere.</p>
            <h3>Aman (The Blessed Realm, The Undying Lands)</h3>
            <p>This continent west of Middle-earth is home to the Ainur or "Holy Ones" (demi-gods or angels), the high elves, and the spirits of the dead. When Ilvatar destroyed Nmenor Aman was removed from the world and thereafter only the ships of the elves could sail to it. Just east of Aman lies the elves' island of Tol Eressea.</p>
            <h3>Middle-earth</h3>
            <p>The realm of mortals. The name "Middle-earth" is a translation of the Old English "Middangeard"?the world beneath heaven and above hell. Most of the events in Tolkien's work take place in the northwestern region of Middle-earth. The characters in The Lord of the Rings, with the exception of Saruman, have little knowledge of what lies to the south and east.</p>
